## Summary
MyGamesList is a (WIP) Python library that creates and edits a mysqlite database on video games and relevent information
such as developer, release date, genres, etc.

## Trello / Feature Roadmap
Not always up to date since I am the only one working on it so the organization isn't as important
https://trello.com/b/169s96xm/mygameslist

## Installations
Need these installed before using MyGamesList
    pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
    python's wikipedia library (pip install wikipedia; https://stackabuse.com/getting-started-with-pythons-wikipedia-api/)
    pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org)
    SQLite (https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/)

## Usage
Not in a usable state at the moment.
In the future:
    -wikipediascraping will take a list of games and scrap all the information it can get from wikipedia on those games
    and compile it into a database
    -I plan to make a separate script for viewing and editting information in the database

## Note
Still very much a Work In Progress and only being worked on in my free time.
